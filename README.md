# Solar-Power-Generation-Forecast
 We identify the problem of effectively capturing complex patterns and fluctuations in solar generation data, while considering various environmental factors. To tackle this problem, we propose a novel machine learning algorithm that combines feature engineering, ensemble learning, and deep learning techniques.
